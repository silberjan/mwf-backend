# Targomo TypeScript Challenge Back End

This is the back end repo that accompanies our [front end challenge](https://github.com/targomo/typescript-challenge-frontend) to make it a full stack challenge :)

## Develop

1. clone the repo
2. `npm run test`
3. To run it locally `npm start`, to run the tests (for TDD) `npm run test`

## Backlog

In this repo, we also have a [backlog of suggestions](https://github.com/targomo/mwf-backend/issues) on what to develop. Please keep in mind that you are not supposed to complete ALL tickets. If you have another idea on what to add to the project that is not in the backlog, please go ahead!
